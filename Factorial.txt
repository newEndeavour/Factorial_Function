Factorial:
The factorial of a nonnegative integer n, n!, is defined as follows:
For n = 0, n! = 0! = 1 and for n ≥ 1, n! is defined in terms of (n-1)! by n! = n(n-1)!.


Rising factorial (Pochhammer):
The rising factorial of a positive integer n with nonnegative length m is d
efined as follows: (n)m = n(n+1)···(n+m-1) = (n+m-1)! / (n-1)!, where, by 
convention, (n)0 = 1. 
The rising factorial is Pochhammer's function, (x)m, 
where x is restricted to the positive integers.
